# Charlieplexing-
Charlieplexing (also known as tristate multiplexing, reduced pin-count LED multiplexing) is a technique for accessing a large number of LEDs, switches,
micro-capacitors or other I/O entities, using very few tri-state logic wires from a microcontroller.
The max number of LEDs controlled can be calculated by n(n-1), here n being the number of pins.
